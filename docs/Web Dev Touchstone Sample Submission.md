[cite_start]• A "View Cart" button is at the top left of the page. [cite: 425]

**Accessibility:**
[cite_start]To provide an accessible experience to the user, all the colors applied to the website have been tested to be color-blind safe using this website: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility. [cite: 447]

--- PAGE 8 ---

[cite_start]To receive full credit, you will need to include at least two additional rationales for accessibility. [cite: 448]
[cite_start]Refer to Tutorial 2.4.5 for accessibility best practices and accessibility testing. [cite: 449]
**Responsive Web Design:**
[cite_start]To make the website design responsive, the viewport would need to be set. [cite: 451]
[cite_start]In the webpage `<head>` tag, the meta tag defines the settings for the viewport. [cite: 452]
[cite_start]For the content, the width of the viewport is set to the width of the device. [cite: 453]
[cite_start]This is particularly important for responsive web design, as it ensures that the width of the page matches the width of the device, which is crucial for proper rendering on various screen sizes. [cite: 454]
[cite_start]The initial scale value is used to set the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. [cite: 455]
[cite_start]A value of 1.0 means that the page is displayed at its original size without any zooming. [cite: 456]
[cite_start]To receive full credit, you will need to include at least two additional RWD elements and rationales. [cite: 457]
[cite_start]Refer to Tutorials 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 for RWD. [cite: 458]
### Website Functionality
The website is designed to be a dynamic and interactive website. [cite_start]It has several interactive features and functionalities as follows: [cite: 460]
[cite_start]**Navigation Bar:** The website has an interactive navigation bar both at the header and footer section, that can redirect the user to other pages of the website. [cite: 461]
[cite_start]**Subscribe Feature:** The footer section of each page has a subscribe feature that inputs the customer email from the user. [cite: 462]
[cite_start]If the user enters the email and clicks the button, an alert window is displayed to show the message "Thank you for subscribing". [cite: 463]
[cite_start]**Add-to-cart Feature:** The gallery page has the add-to-cart feature where if the user clicks the add-to-cart button for an item, that item will be added to the shopping cart. [cite: 464]
[cite_start]**View Cart Feature:** The view-cart feature opens a modal window that displays the currently added items to the shopping cart. [cite: 465]
[cite_start]Inside the modal window, the user can either process orders or clear the cart items. [cite: 466]
[cite_start]If the user decides to process the order, then an alert window will be displayed with the message "Thank you for your order!". [cite: 467]
[cite_start]Otherwise, if the user decides to clear the cart, then the alert window will display the message "Cart is cleared!". [cite: 468]
[cite_start]**Contact Us Feature:** On the About Us webpage, the user can input their name, email address, phone number, and feedback/custom order information in the form. [cite: 469]
[cite_start]If the 'submit' button is clicked, then an alert window will display the message "Thank you for your message" including the username. [cite: 470]
[cite_start]Otherwise, the clear form button will clear the form entries. [cite: 471]

--- PAGE 9 ---

### Web Data Storage
[cite_start]The website utilizes web data storage and incorporates both session Storage and localStorage in the webpages as follows: [cite: 473]
**Shopping Cart Feature:**
[cite_start]Every time the "Add to Cart" button is clicked for an item on the Gallery page, the item is added to the session Storage. [cite: 475]
[cite_start]The "View Cart" feature checks for all the entries in the sessionStorage and displays the information of all the items in the session Storage in the modal window. [cite: 476]
[cite_start]The "Clear Cart" and "Process Order" features remove the entries from the session Storage. [cite: 477]
[cite_start]**Contact Us Feature:** When the "Submit" button is clicked for the Contact Us form on the About Us webpage, an object is created with the submitted information containing the username, email address, phone number, and feedback/custom order information. [cite: 478]
[cite_start]That object is then saved in the localStorage. [cite: 479]

--- PAGE 10 ---

### Customization
[cite_start]The Community Corner page is a valuable addition to the bakery website, serving as an extension of the Homepage, Gallery page, and Contact Us page. [cite: 481]
[cite_start]While the Homepage introduces the bakery, the Gallery page showcases its offerings, and the Contact Us page facilitates communication, the Community Corner page establishes a deeper connection. [cite: 482]
[cite_start]It highlights customer experiences, creates a sense of community and trust, and provides insights into the bakery's involvement in local activities and events, emphasizing shared values and collaborations. [cite: 483]
[cite_start]This page contributes to the overall narrative, reinforcing the bakery's identity as not just a business but also a valued community member. [cite: 484]

### Description of Issues
`<include screenshot(s) or paste code below and provide a description of issue>`
[cite_start]The font color I initially picked did not work well when placed over the pink color background in the website header. [cite: 910]
[cite_start]I went back and tested all three font options in an accessibility checker tool, and I decided on a different color option that would be more aesthetically pleasing and accessible. [cite: 911]
I did not have any issues with my code. [cite_start]All components function as intended. [cite: 912]
